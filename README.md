# Vex Code 1965M  

## Overview  
This is the github repository for the vex team 1965M.  
Written in Vexcode Pro V5 in C++  
The extra files are not needed, the main folder is 1965MCode.
I would suggest not to use this code as it is poorly maintained and may contain errors. This repo is only for version control for my vex team.
